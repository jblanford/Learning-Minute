Learning Minute Prototype - Copyright (c) 2010 John Blanford

The learning minute is a prototype of an application designed to pull active content from a
backend server and display it to users.  In this case the content is short bits of learning
material.

The app talks to a Drupal based backend via JSON-rpc.  The content on the server is organized into
channels.  The app can be configured to load content from one or more channels.

The application code is made freely available under the MIT license.  See LICENSE.txt for details.
