        {"text": "A.  Yes they do"},

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "<p>The correct answer is A.</p><p>Customer service representatives must understand that their clients do talk to other customers. Research has shown that one bad experience is communicated to at least 25 other individuals. On the other hand, one positive experience is communicated to an average of 10-12 people. Therefore, it is important for customer service representatives to carefully manage their customers experiences and ensure that positive impressions are made, problems are resolved and customers leave satisfied.</p>"
